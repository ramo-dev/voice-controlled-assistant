# Voice-Controlled Assistant using Flask

<!-- Short Description -->
This project aims to create a voice-controlled assistant using Flask, enabling users to interact with the application by speaking voice commands.

## Features

<!-- Feature 1 -->
- **Basic Voice Input Handling:** The app currently handles basic voice input using Flask.
<!-- Feature 2 -->
- **Homepage:** The default route ("/") displays the homepage of the Flask app.
<!-- Feature 3 -->
- **Voice Command Processing:** The app contains a route ("/voice-command") that will handle incoming voice commands and perform basic actions based on the received command.
<!-- Feature 4 -->
- **Response to Commands:** The app responds with a simple message ("Voice command processed.") upon receiving a voice command.

## Upcoming Features

<!-- Feature 1 -->
- **Integration with Speech Recognition:** The project will integrate a speech recognition library to accurately convert voice to text for processing commands.
<!-- Feature 2 -->
- **Command-Based Actions:** Implement actions corresponding to specific voice commands (e.g., weather information retrieval, setting reminders, fetching data from APIs, etc.).
<!-- Feature 3 -->
- **Enhanced User Interaction:** Develop a more interactive and responsive user experience by providing appropriate feedback or responses to user voice commands.
<!-- Feature 4 -->
- **Security Measures:** Implement security measures to handle user data and ensure secure interactions between the user and the application.
